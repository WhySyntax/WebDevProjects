5 Websites:
Discord: Well designed, minimal space for improvement
I personally like the design of discord. It's very minimalistic, yet it still has all the expected options avalible without having to use the (also very avalible) search bar.

Canvas: good enough, some issues are user-end
menus are well-designed. limited options for customization (please have native dark mode). issues with overload of information are mostly issues with the professors.

Fandom:good organization within wikis, everything else is shit
they need better options for hiding spoilers, give writers the ability to make versions of a page based on where someone is within a series. also the ads are very pervasize and why are they promoting other wikis, same spoiler problem.

StackOverflow: amazing
I love any sorting system that uses any form of tags, tho what's the point of having hot questions, just tell users to search or chose tags to search for.

Linn Benton Student portal: I completely hate it.
Theres literally just a grid of links. Due to the size of my screen, I can't read the labels for the bottom row, and there's no scrolling enabled. The individual links also don't have any description, when I first registered for courses, I couldn't find my course materials until after one of my professors told us about moodle. If there was even a simple blurb "access course content" it would've been so damn helpful.
