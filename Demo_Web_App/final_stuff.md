# Review of Sites I picked at start of term
### Discord
design is still neat, I like the placement of the sidebars.

### Canvas
Native dark mode is so damn simple, why not do it.

### Fandom
My gripes were never about the design in the first place, the design is fine. It's just that their ad placement is abyssmal and they seem like they're actively *trying* to spoil users.

### Stackoverflow
Still Great, very simplistic and minimal.

### Linn Benton Student Portal
Still absolutely horrible. Now that I know more about html and CSS, my gripes have increased in intensity, adding blurbs and making it scrollable would be beyond simple, if nothing else, they can just add hover text.

# Review of my projects
Since for all my assignments but assignment 5 I just added to what I already had, I don't fully remember what I added at each part. I do like how I have my "wiki" organized, but there isn't much to it. The main things that are needed to make my project functional are all missing. My project looks ok, and there is a definite method to the organization that's useful, but that's it.  
My assignment 5 was my favorite. The design was very barebones, but I liked making something functional.
